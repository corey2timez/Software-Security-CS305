# Software-Security-CS305
#1 Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client Artemis Financial a consultant company, was looking to modernize their operations by using the most current and effective software security. They would like to add a file verification step to their web application, they would also like a data verification step in the form of a checksum.

#2 What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I believe I acknowledged the vulnerabilities and reformatted the code to help secure the program as a whole well. It is important to code securely in order to protect any information that could be compromised by an attacker. The value software security adds to a company is that it would bring integrity into the company this would ensure to both the workers and customers that their information is safe and secure.

#3 What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

When doing a vulnerability assessment I found it to be challenging in weeding out the false positives or the vulnerabilities that are not important. This is because you would want to make sure that everything is handled when it comes to the vulnerabilities so everything can seem believable at times and you would need to check and make sure that it is relevant.

#4 How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

When checking to make sure that the application was running correctly I would run the program and check the local host to see if it had met the needs that I was after at the time.

#5 What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

When coding I used a few good resources that helped me in my assignments. Oracle was a big help, It allowed me to find the algorithm that would be best for the software application. This website also helped in giving me directions on how to import algorithms into software as well.

#6 Employers sometimes ask for examples of work you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

From this assignment, I would point out many things. One would be the organization of the code, everything was labeled correctly and would be easy to find if needed. I also used commenting, this would help if there was any confusion on parts of the code by describing the different sections.
